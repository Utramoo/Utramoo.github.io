All of life is impacted by your relationships with people, yet establishing relationships is difficult. 
You can’t get along with some people, and you can’t make it without them. 
That’s why it is essential to build proper relationships with others in our crowded world.

             <var>What is attitude? How do you put your finger on it?. Well, attitude is an inward feeling
              expressed by behavior. That is why an attitude can be seen without a word being said.
              Haven’t we all noticed “the pout” of the sulker, or the “jutted jaw” of the determined? Of all
              the things we wear, our expression is the most important.
              Sometimes our attitude can be masked outwardly and others who see us are fooled. But usually the
              cover-ups will not last long. There is that constant struggle as the attitude tries to wiggle its way out.
              Psychologist/philosopher James Allen states, “A person cannot travel within and stand still without.” Soon what is
               happening within us will affect what is happening without. A hardened attitude is a dreaded disease. 
               It causes a closed mind and a dark future. When our attitude is positive and conducive to growth, the mind expands and the progress begins.
